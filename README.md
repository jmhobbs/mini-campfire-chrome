# Mini-Campfire Chrome Extension

This is a fork of the [Mini-Campfire](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/mini-campfire/kioodigallkkhmaledjkkhgndkilaloi?hl=en) Chrome extension.

This uses the original icons and tweaked CSS.  Instead of always injecting beneath a certain page width, this lets you toggle it on and off with a URL bar button.

## Fork?

Credit for the original concept, icon and excellent CSS goes to @jeremyricketts - http://jeremyricketts.com

I just added the pageAction support because I preferred to trigger it on and off myself.

## How does it work?

1) Install it - https://github.com/jmhobbs/mini-campfire-chrome/releases

2) Go to Campfire on a small window and lament the crowded interface.

3) Click the icon in your browser bar for instant relief!

4) Enjoy the size-adjusted interface.

5) If you need access to any of the hidden tools, just click the icon again to normalify it.
